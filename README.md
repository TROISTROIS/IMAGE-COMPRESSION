# IMAGE-COMPRESSION
I am using the K-Means clustering algorithm to perform image compression. I will first start on an example 2D dataset to gain an intuition on how the K-means algorithm works. After that, I will use the algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.
